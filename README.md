The idea of this game is that the user presses one button to controller a jumper that avoids spikes, collects coins, and collects hearts.
To code this I AI-generated a simple game of snake and then stripped that down and used it as reference point for coding my game. I particularly consulted AI for help in detecting collision.
I largely coded this game in notepad before eventually moving it to vsCode.
